<h1>A Social News Program</h1>
<h4>by Daniel Beckley. &copy 2020.</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight:700">Project: a social news program</span><hr>
    Now that you’ve discovered the basics of programming, let’s go ahead and build a real project.<br><br>
    Objective<hr>
    The goal of this project is to build a basic social news program. Its users will be able to show a
    list of links and add new ones.<br><br>
    Functional requirements<hr>
    • A link is defined by its title, its URL and its author (submitter).<br>
    • If a new link URL does not start with "http://" or "https://", "http://" is automatically
    added to its beginning.<br>
    • At launch, the program displays a start menu with the possible actions in an alert window
    and asks the user for his choice. Possible actions are:<br>
    – Show the list of links.<br>
    – Add a new link.<br>
    – Remove an existing link.<br>
    – Quit the program.<br>
    • Showing the list of links displays the index (rank) and the properties of each link in an alert
    window, or a message in the absence of any link.<br>
    • When adding a link, the program asks the user for the new link properties (title, URL and
    author). The link is then created. Subsequently, it must appear in the shown links.<br>
    • When removing a link, the user is asked for the link index until it is correct. The associated
    link is then removed. Subsequently, it must disappear from the shown links. Removing a
    link is not possible if there are no existing links.<br>
    • After an action is performed, the start menu is shown again. This goes on until the user
    chooses to quit the program.<br><br>
    Technical requirements<hr>
    • All your code should be correctly indented.<br>
    • Names should be wisely chosen and adhere to the camelCase convention.<br>
    • Code duplication should be avoided.</p>
